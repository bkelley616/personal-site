### Graduate School

As mentioned in the previous post - a big update to share is that I have been accepted into Georgia Tech's Masters in Analytics program! Now you may be wondering why I am going for analytics rather than computer science which is what my undergraduate degree is in. The reason why is that I wanted to diversify my skills while remaining technical. Despite being a technical degree this analytics program mixes in learning business, statistics, and programming. My current plan is to take a single class a semester and just go through the program at a relaxed pace. That way I can keep working full-time and have time for my dog and personal life. This one class a semester will likely replace the time I currently use for side projects but I think it's a good trade off.

Career wise, the plan is that by getting this degree I can either land myself a more senior programmer role in the near future or more likely a data scientist role with the possibility of becoming a manager further down the road -  that is,  if I decide I want to become a non-technical role. Currently I enjoy having a technical position far too much but I think the business part especially will help if I do ever change my mind. Also,even a data scientist is classified under business rather than IT so it will help there as well!

Anyways, that's all for now - until next time :)
