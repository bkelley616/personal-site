### Intro
Now that I have been working at Progressive Insurance as an Application Programmer (mostly as an intern, recently converted to salaried full timer after my college graduation) for about a year remotely (but based out of Mayfield, OH), I think it would be a good time to share my thoughts and experiences. With that said, the first thing that shows something great about Progressive is that they are open to discourse. I feel many people would ordinarily be somewhat weary of providing any open criticism to who they work for, but with Progressive I am not worried at all. In fact I have noticed that ideas and criticism are welcome. If you ever do happen to have a problem, it is simply a matter of going to the correct person to talk to and you can be sure it will be handled appropriately. The culture and people really are what makes a difference. As an intern I have had conversations with our domain architect about accessibility best practices, done live demos of internal tools I made to as high up as group managers, met with our lead data scientist (which confirmed my desire to do grad school in analytics), worked one on one with our consultant level developer consistently, participate in code review discussions, etc. Everyone is available and always happy to help or just tell you about themselves. Oftentimes I would see someone in a meeting and just reach out to them to see what they do and get to know them personally. I feel that building that bond of knowing someone really helps when it comes to working with them as well as the whole networking side of things. Furthermore, as an intern or really just a new hire in general, everyone was so patient, helpful and supportive to the point where I feel like my project team is like a second family. You can tell everyone cares about one another and there is a large sense of comradery between everyone. I truly don't believe I would be where I am at without all the mentorship and support from my intern manager, team manager, mentor, other developers, and the rest of my project team and department.<br><br> 

### Work-Life Balance
One of the best things about Progressive is the work-life balance. I have never once been expected (or asked) to stay late and grind out some piece of work or anything like that. I have stayed late to finish something up or for other various reasons such as meetings since I choose to work from 7am - 3:30pm which sometimes misses people who prefer later meetings, but every time it was on my own accord. But it always balances out in the end, sometimes you have busier weeks and other weeks are slower. The fact that they are so flexible with scheduling is one of my favorite perks. Like I mentioned, I am an early bird and like to start and end my day early. The quiet time before most people log on in the mornings are probably my most productive hours. I think of it as what my old mentor would call ‚Äúheads down coding time.‚Äù No meetings, no distractions, just a good time to get some work done. But it's nice knowing that the opposite end of the spectrum exists for people that either have family or other commitments (or just want to sleep in). Similarly, if you happen to have an appointment during work hours, it is totally ok to go to that during the day and then come back and make up the time later. Small things like that make all the difference and really makes the team want to work better for Progressive since everyone is respected and treated so well!<br><br> 

### Diversity and Inclusion
Moving onto diversity and inclusion, which Progressive is a leader in. They make sure that our company is filled with people from all different walks of life and backgrounds. Many people I have met are from all over , not only the United States, but world! What is great is that the diversity isn‚Äôt only from an ethnicity / culture background but also from technical backgrounds. While most people I have talked to have a 4 year degree, many people are from coding boot camps, associate degrees or even self taught. Progressive makes it super easily to not only move upwards but also move laterally. There are many people I have met that have started off in one department to find out that either its not for them, or they just want new scenery, and move to an equivalent role doing something totally different! Having this wide spectrum of experiences really helps everyone get out of their own implicit bias and leads overall to a non-homogenous way of thinking. I truly enjoy getting to know everyone as well as their story rather than ‚Äújust‚Äù being coworkers. There is so much to learn from seeing how and why others think and comparing that to our own experiences.<br><br> 

### Technical
Now that you know the culture is awesome, what about the actual technical software development? I would say that it's as good as you can get from the enterprise level. I work in direct quoting, which is the website you use when buying insurance straight from us rather than using an agent, where our tech stack revolves around C# and Angular 2+. Coming into my role as an intern, the C# was fairly similar to what I learned at Cleveland State but Angular was quite the learning curve as Single Page Applications were not really taught in school. Side Note on that - that was one item of feedback I gave Cleveland State, they need to spend more time teaching web development. But anyways, I was able to get a Pluralsight license from Progressive where I went through the Angular pathway and watched NGRX conference videos. After about 100 hours or so of following along in these courses and doing some side projects, I was extremely comfortable with Angular which in turn amplified the amount of side projects and learning I now do outside of work and school.  So overall, I am pleased with the tech stack and find it not too bad to work with. Of course I won‚Äôt lie to you and say that Progressive is run like a startup and daily code pushes to prod or anything crazy like that. You simply don‚Äôt find that at the enterprise level but we do have what I imagine to be a relatively modern, albeit safe/stable,  tech stack and process. Although there are many processes or ‚Äúred-tape‚Äù in place and that comes at the cost of working for such a massive company. But I don‚Äôt necessarily say that is Progressives fault but rather what comes with working at an enterprise vs a small or medium size company. I actually find the stable environment and experienced developers very conducive to learning. I am fortunate to always have had nothing short of amazing developers that are able to pass their domain knowledge onto me but also improve myself as a developer in general. All in all, I am content with where our tech stack currently is and glad that we are solving difficult problems where I am growing as a developer.<br><br> 

### Summary
All things considered, I am very pleased with my experiences so far at Progressive and see this as a place that I could easily stay for many years and make my career here. I am looking forward to continuing to work with my team and growing as a developer! Lastly, I must put the disclaimer that this has been my only relevant job to software development so I unable to directly compare multiple experiences, although I would be comfortable from my experience here as well as anecdotal stories from my peers and co-workers to personally say Progressive is easily the best large company to work for in North East, Ohio. <br><br>
