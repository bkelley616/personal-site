### Book Review

I recently finished reading {% link(href="https://www.refactoringui.com/") %} Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan, Steve Schoger {% end %} as part of my desire to learn more about web design and absolutely loved it. I first heard of them when looking up the current trends in styling libraries and stumbled upon tailwindcss which they created. While it took some getting used to using a utility based styling library - I am totally in love with it now, at least for small projects, I am curious to see how it scales on larger projects. So from the start I knew the book by them would be just as good as the numerous tutorials and content they have put out.. Although, I will say that the price ($100) is pretty steep for the book in my opinion but at the same time I think there is a lot of good re-read value especially for when you are actively in the middle of creating something. Additionally, they include a license to use the SVG kit that includes two-tone detailed svgs that are good to be shown at larger size. As well as some other miscellaneous content like font and color theme recommendations. I will note that the inclusion of this extra content and recommendations from the authors do make up for some of the large purchase price. What was also great was that the actual book content is accompanied by many graphics and examples making it easily digestible for even non-designers like myself. Overall I am very pleased with the book and hope to reference it in the future as needed.
