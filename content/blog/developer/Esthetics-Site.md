### Tech Stack and Details

My latest project has been working on a site for my friend who recently graduated from esthetics school! The website is called {% link(href="https://www.refactoringui.com/") %} INSERT HERE {% end %}, go check it out and come back! This project was a lot of fun and taught me so much about web design and animation! Since learning about {% link(href="https://tailwindcss.com/") %} Tailwind {% end %} and reading {% link(href="https://www.refactoringui.com/") %} Refactoring UI {% end %} by its creators, I have been looking for a project that is able to expand my knowledge when it comes to web design and animation. Unlike my own site, this website relies exclusively on tailwind (other than one font file) for the styling. Meanwhile I used {% link(href="https://alpinejs.dev/") %} AlpineJS {% end %} to handle any lightweight javascript needs. More importantly, I learned how to use {% link(href="https://barba.js.org/") %} BarbaJS {% end %} to create transitions between pages as well as implementing optimizations by preloading web requests prior to navigation actions. The transition lifecycle hooks that barbaJS provides fit fantastically with {% link(href="https://animejs.com/") %} AnimeJS {% end %} which I used to handle any complex animations on the site. Meanwhile, I used {% link(href="https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/") %} Locomotive Scroll {% end %} to implement smooth scrolling, scroll position based css animations, and the scroll to top button.<br><br>

### Next Steps

The next steps I have are to take a break from solely creating websites and focus on finishing up the learning I want to do for Elixir and Phoenix. I have already completed two courses on {% link(href="https://www.udemy.com/") %} udemy {% end %} and I am currently taking an Elixir/OTP course on {% link(href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/") %} pragmaticstudio {% end %} that I will follow up with the corrosponding Phoneix Liveview course in the bundle. Concurrently I am also reading through the official documentation for both Elixir and Phoenix. Once I complete all of the learning material I hope to have found a unique idea for my next side project to complete using each of them!
