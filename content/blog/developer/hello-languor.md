It’s been a while but the past few months or so I have been spending my time learning a lot about Elixir and Phoenix! The side project idea that I came up with and got up and running is called “languor”. The plan with languor is to have it be an open source umbrella project in Elixir that has a main parent site and multiple children sites, with each being a unique multiplayer web game that is created using Phoenix Channels and a front end JavaScript game library such as {% link(href="https://phaser.io/") %} Phaser {% end %}. So far I was able to create the parent site that will link to all the secondary game sites under it. This can be found at {% link(href="https://www.languor.co/") %} languor.co {% end %} where I have more information in the readme! The next steps are to start building the first game but that may take some time since I recently got accepted into grad school at Georgia Tech which will replace quite a bit of my side project time.  More info on that to come in the next post!
