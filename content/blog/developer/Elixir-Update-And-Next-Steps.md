### Learning Update

##### Hey! - Just a little update on my progress learning Elixir and the Phoenix framework:
<br>

###### I have completed the following online courses:

{% link(href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/") %}Udemy - The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp and Tutorial {% end %} <br>
{% link(href="https://www.udemy.com/course/elixir-phoenix-real-world-functional-programming/") %}Udemy - Elixir Phoenix Real World Functional Programming {% end %} <br>

{% link(href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/elixir") %}Pragmatic Studio - Elixir and OTP{% end %} <br>
{% link(href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/phoenix-liveview") %}Pragmatic Studio - Phoenix Liveview Pro{% end %}<br>

<br>

###### and read the following books:

{% link(href="https://pragprog.com/titles/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4/") %}Programming Phoenix > 1.4 by by Chris McCord, Bruce Tate and José Valim{% end %}<br>
{% link(href="https://pragprog.com/titles/sbsockets/real-time-phoenix/") %}Real Time Phoenix by Stephen Bussey{% end %}<br>

<br>

With these courses and books now finished, I have a solid foundation of both Elixir and Phoenix. My next step is to start a side project that makes excellent use of Elixir’s distributed and highly concurrent properties. I'm currently thinking of making an “.io game”, which if you are unfamiliar, is basically a free to play internet game that has massive amounts of people playing at the same time. The most popular examples being {% link(href="https://agar.io/") %}agar.io{% end %} and {% link(href="http://slither.io/") %}slither.io{% end %}. I believe combining Elixir, Phoenix Web Sockets, and a Javascript game library such as Phaser would make an ideal combination for such a game!
<br><br>
We'll see how it goes - more to come!
