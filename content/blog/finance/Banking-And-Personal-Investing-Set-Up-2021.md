### Intro
Sometime ago, I decided having a Vanguard for investing, PNC for banking and then multiple accounts with various credit card issuers was somewhat overwhelming and inefficient. On one hand I could have embraced the complexity by trying to hunt for the highest interest rate savings account, best investment platform, and so on but I ultimately decided on not going that route. I wanted to make my checking, saving, and investment accounts as seamless as possible but decided on still using whatever company‚Äôs credit card fits my needs best. After doing some typical reddit research and reading some nerdwallet articles I decided on using {% link(href="https://www.chase.com/") %} Chase {% end %} as my platform to simplify my finances.<br><br> 

### Chase Details
Starting off, Chase had an elegant and intuitive UI that provided a portal for everything all in one place, as well as many physical locations should I ever need in person support. Chase provided me a checking account which had overdraft protection into a savings account that I use as an emergency fund. While the interest rate is extremely low on the Chase savings account, I decided to take that as a cost of simplifying my finances to all be in one platform as well as receiving the convenience that any emergency fund usage could be done quickly through an internal transfer rather than wiring the money or doing the standard ACH transfer which can take a few days. Furthermore, while you can set up automatic transfers and investing with external platforms, creating my general brokerage account and ROTH IRA couldn‚Äôt have been easier with Chase. Then setting up automatic transfers as well as being able to see all of my accounts in one place was great. While Chase is not good for frequent traders in terms of commission fees or flexibility (doesn't allow you to purchase certain stocks like penny stocks), they were perfect for my investment needs as they had zero commission mutual fund transactions meanwhile providing access to Vanguard and Fidelity mutual funds.<br><br>  

Note regarding linking external accounts to the Chase portal - I tried linking my Fidelity 401k and various credit card accounts in the Chase portal which worked but I ran into issues since I use two factor authentication on everything. This resulted in the external accounts needing constant new logins and was overall not worth the effort nor the loss of security to disable two factor authentication.<br><br>

Now that I have two Chase credit cards, those are yet another two accounts that are able to be managed in one portal. Although right now I don‚Äôt have a car loan or a mortgage, I would prefer to have those be through Chase as well for the added convenience if possible. Although these would need to be compared more closely as a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù difference in interest rates when it comes to loans will result in many thousands of differences paid over the life of the loan. Guess we will see when (and if with these pricesüòÖ) I buy a home. <br><br>
