### Background

My credit card history serendipitously began when my Mom added me as an authorized user to her Kohls card so that way I could buy clothes without needing her to be there. This was about 8 years ago and unknowing to her, that actually started my own credit history. It seems to factor in and show in different degrees depending on the bureau but nonetheless when I went to go get my first credit card, my fico score was showing in the low 700‚Äôs from 8 years of credit card history on ‚Äúmy‚Äù record! If I end up having kids, I will be sure to do the same but only this time on purpose. üòÑ<br><br>

### Current Set-Up

With that bit of context out of the way, which likely explains how I was able to get a fairly large amount of credit in a short time, I got my first credit card at 20 years old and shortly prior to getting my internship as a software developer. This card was the {% link(href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cash-back/it-card.html") %} Discover IT (student) card {% end %} which offers 5% cash back on quarterly rotating categories with 1% on everything else. This came with a sign up bonus of Discover matching the cashback earned for the first year effectively creating a 10% rotating category card with 2% back on everything else for the first year. After reading that 6 months is a fairly safe waiting time between most cards I decided to apply for the {% link(href="https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/freedom/CFD2021") %} Chase Freedom Flex Card{% end %} which similar to the Discover card I got is also a quarterly rotating 5% back but also with 5% on travel booked through Chase, 3% on drugstores / dining and with a signup cash bonus after spending some amount. Then a month later I, somewhat stupidly, applied for the {% link(href="https://card.americanexpress.com/d/cm/blue-cash-everyday-credit-card") %} American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card{% end %}. Which has 3% Back on Groceries, 2% back on department stores gas stations, and 1% back on everything else. But the main reason I applied was for the Amazon sign-up bonus which ended up allowing me to save around $600 on holiday and birthday gifts for the next 6 months. Which if you are wondering - yes I just buy gift cards for gifts‚Ä¶ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what can I say, it's more efficient for all parties involved. üòÅ Lastly, about 5 months later, I got the {% link(href="https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/amazon") %} Chase Amazon Card{% end %} that gave me 5% back on Amazon as well as a decent sign up bonus on approval. I was fortunate to be able to get all these cards without being declined but I would most likely credit it to my accidental credit history from my mom with my decent intern salary of $20 / hr.<br><br>

### 4 credit cards at 21 ?!
Now I know what you are thinking, having this many cards at 21 seems alarming (rightfully so), it's important to know the reason why I don‚Äôt even mention anything like interest rates of the cards is because I pay them off at the end of each month, never carrying a balance. My approach is to put one cheap subscription on each card because I know I don‚Äôt spend enough to take advantage of all of them, but this way I get each credit institution reporting back on time monthly payments, which helps build my score as well as preventing the card from getting automatically closed due to inactivity. I could go the route of manually remembering which card I need to put activity on every few months but in my opinion, the extra on time payments and convenience is worth it. Which I only add subscriptions my family and I use. Another important thing to mention is all of these cards have no annual fees. I simply don‚Äôt think annual fees are worth the effort involved in trying to recoup your ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù by taking advantage of the card perks and required spending to come out ahead. Similarly all my cards are cashback, as you could optimize for points especially by transferring them to other cards that let you redeem them at different rates but I find cashback to be easier to manage. Not to mention the points usually apply to travel, which I hardly do any of.<br><br>


### Maximizing Cash Back

The current way I am maximizing my cashback is by first seeing if the two rotating category cards apply to whatever the purchase may be. They usually tend to not overlap which means there usually is about two quarters of 5% back on gas and groceries which I use the respective card for, which I then fall back to {% link(href="https://card.americanexpress.com/d/cm/blue-cash-everyday-credit-card") %} Blue Cash Everyday Card's{% end %} 3% on groceries / 2% on gas. This results in an average yearly cash back of 4% on groceries and 3.5% on gas that is quite good given the no annual fee. This method repeats itself for practically all my expense, such as food. Check the 5% rotating cards other not fall back to the 3% on dining from the {% link(href="https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/freedom/CFD2021") %} Chase Freedom Flex {% end %}. For most of my spending there is a card I have that provides at least 2% back but some areas aren‚Äôt covered or aren‚Äôt covered the whole year (5% category may happen to cover it for a quarter). The second main optimization for cashback I do is through Amazon. Know that I have (and love) Amazon Prime (otherwise the card would only give 3% back rather than 5%). This allows my {% link(href="https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/amazon") %} Chase Amazon Card{% end %} to give 5% back on all Amazon purchases but what is more unique is savings when combined with the ‚Äúsubscribe and save‚Äù program. This program allows you to opt in to recurring purchases, consisting mostly of household consumables, with a 5% discount for recurring shipment and a 15% discount if it contains five or more items. Since I still live with my parents, I can‚Äôt take advantage of its full potential, but getting a 15% discount with 5% makes the pricing competitive, especially given the added bonus convenience of eliminating my monthly Target run!üòÉ<br><br>

### Possible Future Cards
Looking forward, I plan on allowing my credit to age a bit while I get ready to hopefully buy a house in the coming year or so. My credit score is currently between 740 - 770 depending on the bureau so I should be able to get a good interest rate on a loan. I am fortunate enough to have a paid off car but I may one day need a loan for that as well. Although, my credit file is actually considered somewhat ‚Äúthin‚Äù due to the lack of loan activity. But I am in no rush to create an expense for the sake of my credit score. Once I secure a house, my first card that I want to get soon after is the {% link(href="https://cashplus.usbank.com/") %} US Bank Cash Plus Card{% end %} that offers 5% on a variety of categories of which you can choose two of, as well as 2% categories which you choose one of. For specifically working this into my current setup I would choose the 5% Home utility category and then either the  5% internet / streaming category or the 5% cell phone provider category. 5% back on these categories would surely add up quick as they likely account for a large portion of recurring monthly expenses. The other card I would consider picking up eventually is the {% link(href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/products/cash-back-credit-card/") %} Bank of America Cash Rewards Card {% end %} that allows you to select a single 3% back category that in my case would likely be online shopping, to cover me on everything but Amazon which I already get 5% back. <br><br>

Past the previous two, I have not decided on other cards. I think the {% link(href="https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/altitude-go-visa-signature-credit-card.html") %} US Bank Altitude Go Card's{% end %} 4% back on dining would be good for a card used exclusively on ordering food and going to restaurants. I would find it interesting to see if a card such as the {% link(href="https://venmo.com/about/creditcard/") %} Venmo Credit Card {% end %} which automatically gives you 3% in whatever category you spend the most in could be used for some niche spending or if you are hitting a reward spending cap on another card.<br><br>
